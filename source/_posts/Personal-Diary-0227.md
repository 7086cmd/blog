After the distribution of teaching classes this semester, the biology class was changed from Class B1 to Class B2, and the former deskmate, who was a good friend of mine in middle school and continued this relationship in high school (the first semester), who was not expected to change the class (because the former teacher is the original teacher of her), was still in Class B1 (I think). I was quite disappointed because of the only 40 minutes of class and the back road from the lunch who accompanied me to the floor of the classroom building. We talked a lot of things, but unexpectedly, the time was so short.

I am very grateful to her because her smile and greeting cured my depression on a quiet level. The mathematics class in middle school B2 includes me and her, and we communicated with her frequently during the break time. Before the Zhongkao, we communicated with each other the night before the examination and encouraged each other. However, after this communication, she disconnected from me, maybe she was hurrying to do other things and her trip to Shanghai.

After entering high school, she greeted me at the meeting of members of the boarders, and I was quite happy that our friendship could be continued in high school.

But I didn't chat with her online or in real life, until the biology class.

I can still remember the time I entered Class 2, I selected the seat behind her and left her to sit in class, which was an unavailable seat. Then I selected the seat in front of her & left her, “but” unexpectedly, the student after my seat wanted to change the seat with me, and I happily agreed. Then she, who was sitting on the right seat now, greeted me with a smile and asked me which course I selected.

I was happy and surprised and had a good time after the day on the road to the classroom and the time during lunch.

We chatted a lot about the application on the weekend, and I went to a camp after that weekend. That is to say, I didn't attend the class next week and didn't chat with her on weekdays on campus. After the first Sunday of the vacation, she went offline to study, and I didn't chat with her until the second day of the vacation.

I expected to communicate with her the next semester, but I didn't expect that she would be changed to Class B1, and I was changed to Class B2. I was quite disappointed, and I didn't chat with her in the first semester.

The teacher of B2 is my former biology teacher, which is a little bit joyful, but I didn't expect that I would be changed to Class B2, and she is still in B1 I thought.
