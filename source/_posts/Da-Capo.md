[Verse 1]
When good old friends are going away
Will you wish them to remember your name?
When good old days are passing away
Will you promise your heart remains the same?

[Chorus]
Never can we suspend the time
Having to leave the tracks behind
There is a longer way ahead, after all

[Verse 2]
There used to be a story teller
Who always painted the sunshine and the rain
One has to eventually grow up
Spending a lifetime to taste the love and pain

[Chorus]
Never can we suspend the time
Having to leave the tracks behind
There is a longer way ahead, after all

[Outro]
If it's too hard to say goodbye
Give us a try to sing a rhyme
"May you, the beauty of this world, always shine"
