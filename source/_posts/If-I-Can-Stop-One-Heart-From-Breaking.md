[Verse]
Birds are born with no shackles
Then what fetters my fate?
Blown away, the white petals
Leave me trapped in the cage

[Pre-Chorus]
The endless isolation
Can wear down my illusion
Someday, I'll make a dream unchained

[Chorus]
Let my heart bravely spread the wings
Soaring past the night, to trace the primal light
Let the clouds heal me of the stains
Gently wipe the sorrow of my life
I dream

[Verse 2]
What is meant by miraclе?
A word outside my days
Once again, repеatable
But how could I escape?

[Pre-Chorus]
No further hesitation
On those unanswered questions
So now, I'll make a dream unchained

[Chorus]
Let my heart bravely spread the wings
Soaring past the night, to trace the primal light
Let the clouds heal me of the stains
Gently wipe the sorrow of my life
I dream

[Chorus]
Let my heart bravely spread the wings
Soaring past the night, to trace the primal light
Let the clouds heal me of the stains
Gently wipe the sorrow of my life
I dream
